## Welcome
EcoservR is a tool for mapping natural capital assets and ecosystem services. It is a re-write of [Ecoserv-GIS](https://www.nature.scot/snh-research-report-954-ecoserv-gis-v33-toolkit-mapping-ecosystem-services-gb-scale) and is currently being developed and tested at Liverpool John Moores University in collaboration with [Natural Capital Solutions](http://www.naturalcapitalsolutions.co.uk/), [Forest Research](forestresearch.gov.uk/), and the [Cheshire Wildlife Trust](https://www.cheshirewildlifetrust.org.uk/) as part of a [Defra](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs) test and trial for the new Environmental Land Management System (ELMS).

## Datasets

list of datasets used in baseline

## Generating a baseline 
brief description of processing steps

## Habitat classification

When all the desired datasets have been added to the basemap, a rule-based classification step assigns a habitat code to each polygons. Currently, the datasets with the ability to inform this classification are OS MasterMap, OS (Open) Greenspace, Priority Habitat Inventory, CROME, and CORINE. Other rules based on polygon size also inform the classification.
