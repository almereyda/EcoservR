EcoservR is a tool for mapping natural capital assets and ecosystem services. It is a re-write of [Ecoserv-GIS](https://www.nature.scot/snh-research-report-954-ecoserv-gis-v33-toolkit-mapping-ecosystem-services-gb-scale) and is currently being developed and tested at Liverpool John Moores University in collaboration with [Natural Capital Solutions](http://www.naturalcapitalsolutions.co.uk/), [Forest Research](forestresearch.gov.uk/), and the [Cheshire Wildlife Trust](https://www.cheshirewildlifetrust.org.uk/) as part of a [Defra](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs) test and trial for the new Environmental Land Management System (ELMS).
