# EcoservR applications

By providing a detailed environmental baseline and evidence-based, nationally consistent measures of ecosystem services, EcoservR can inform and support initiatives underpinned by natural capital principles, such as net-gain development, green infrastructure strategies, zero carbon targets, etc.


Here are some of our ongoing projects that use EcoservR.

## Upper Dane catchment ELMS Test and Trial

The new Environmental Land Management System (ELMS), set to replace the Common Agricultural Policy in the UK, will revolve around using "public money for public goods" to support agri-environmental schemes. We are using EcoservR to develop an environmental baseline of the Dane river catchment area (Cheshire) and quantify ecosystem services at farm- to landscape- scale to help inform land management plans. This test and trial is funded by Defra from January to August 2020.
