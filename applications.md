# EcoservR applications

By providing a detailed environmental baseline and evidence-based, nationally consistent measures of ecosystem services, EcoservR can inform and support initiatives underpinned by natural capital principles, such as net-gain development, green infrastructure strategies, zero carbon targets, etc.

Here are some of our ongoing projects that use EcoservR.

## Upper Dane catchment ELMS Test and Trial

We are using EcoservR to develop an environmental baseline of the Dane river catchment area (Cheshire) and quantify ecosystem services at farm- to landscape- scale to help inform land management plans. This test and trial is funded by Defra from January to August 2020.
