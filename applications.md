# EcoservR applications



## Upper Dane catchment ELMS Test and Trial

We are using EcoservR to develop an environmental baseline of the Dane river catchment area (Cheshire) and quantify ecosystem services at farm- to landscape- scale to help inform land management plans. This test and trial is funded by Defra from January to August 2020.
