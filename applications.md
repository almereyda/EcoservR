# EcoservR applications

By providing a detailed environmental baseline and evidence-based, nationally consistent measures of ecosystem services, EcoservR can inform and support initiatives underpinned by natural capital principles, such as net-gain development, green infrastructure strategies, zero carbon targets, etc.

## Upper Dane catchment ELMS Test and Trial

The new Environmental Land Management System (ELMS), set to replace the Common Agricultural Policy in the UK, will revolve around using "public money for public goods" to support agri-environmental schemes. We are using EcoservR to develop an environmental baseline of the Dane river catchment area (Cheshire) and quantify ecosystem services at farm- to landscape- scale to help inform land management plans. This test and trial is funded by Defra from January to August 2020.

## Liverpool City Region

Environmental Net Gain is supported in the Governments 25-Year Environment Plan and the 2020 White paper Planning for the Future. We are using EcoservR to assess change in natural capital and ecosystem services flow and demand due to “real life” planned developments in the Liverpool City Region. These changes have been measured at different geographical extents, from site scale to the whole of the Liverpool City Region. This analysis can be used to inform decision making and policy at a number of levels - for example, at site scale this can inform developers design processes, at the ward, local authority or city region extent, this can inform strategic planning.
