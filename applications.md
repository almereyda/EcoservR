# EcoservR applications

By providing a detailed environmental baseline and evidence-based, nationally consistent measures of ecosystem services, EcoservR can inform and support initiatives underpinned by natural capital principles, such as net-gain development, green infrastructure strategies, zero carbon targets, etc.

## Upper Dane catchment ELMS Test and Trial

Environmental Land Management is the cornerstone of our new agricultural policy. Founded on the principle of “public money for public goods”, it is intended to provide a powerful vehicle for achieving the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan and commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, while supporting our rural economy’.  

Farmers and other land managers may enter into agreements to be paid for delivering the following public goods:  
+ Clean and plentiful water                                              
+ Thriving plants and wildlife 
+ Reduction in and protection from environmental hazards 
+ Adaptation to and mitigation of climate change 
+ Beauty, heritage and engagement with the environment  

In this report we demonstrate the use of EcoservR to develop a natural capital baseline of the Dane river catchment area (Cheshire). We also quantify changes in the delivery of ecosystem services at farm- to landscape- scale arising from agri-environmental interventions. This modelling approach could help inform land management plans. This test and trial was funded by Defra from December 2019 to August 2020.

## Liverpool City Region

Environmental Net Gain is supported in the Governments 25-Year Environment Plan and the 2020 White paper Planning for the Future. We are using EcoservR to assess change in natural capital and ecosystem services flow and demand due to “real life” planned developments in the Liverpool City Region. These changes have been measured at different geographical extents, from site scale to the whole of the Liverpool City Region. This analysis can be used to inform decision making and policy at a number of levels - for example, at site scale this can inform developers design processes, at the ward, local authority or city region extent, this can inform strategic planning.
